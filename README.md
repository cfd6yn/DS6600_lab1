# Problem 1
Reason for chosen license - MIT License

MIT License fullfills the required permissions allowing both commercial and private use. Distribution and modification are permitted as well, according to its documentation. While MIT is permissive which means users can choose another permissive license but not make it more restrictive than MIT. 

If I had not supplied a license, legally, no one would be able to use, copy, or distribute my code with right.
